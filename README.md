# Web Application for designing Solar DC Pump

I have created a Web Application for Solar DC Pump design calculation. Using input parameters such as Water drawn/day, elevation, and peak sunshine hours, the Solar DC Pump system can be designed effectively with calculated PV and Pump rating.
I have made this web application using Python + Streamlit, and deployment is done through Heroku.
